Morris Kline's *Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach* starts with this statement:

    Anyone who adds to the plethora of introductory calculus texts owes an explanation, if not an apology, to the mathematical community. I believe that an introductory course in the calculus *should present the subject intuitively and should relate it as closely as possible to science*.
    
[emphasis is mine]

My excuse, in writing a book about calculus, is that it is primarily an exercise for myself.  Gathering together examples shamelessly appropriated from authors I particularly admire, I hope to solidify the ideas in my mind, and provide a ready reference containing my favorite derivations and examples.  But this is emphatically not an authoritative book.

In addition to Kline, my other top calculus textbooks are Richard Hamming's *Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics*, and Gil Strang's *Calculus*.  Strang's book is excellent and is available for free on the web.

The first three books share a world view which minimizes the formalism of limits.  Here, we will manipulate differentials algebraically, and do so without feeling any trace of guilt.  Basic theory is covered, but the goal is to get to applications.

There are not many problems in this book, because I wanted to minimize the length.  However, to learn this material, you must do lots of problems.  As the old saying goes, "mathematics is not a spectator sport", or as Hamming puts it:

    You cannot learn to do mathematics without effort. “There is no royal road to geometry” was said in ancient Greek times, (Menaechmus to Alexander, around 300 B.C.).

It wouldn't hurt to work through the examples in this book with paper and pen, as you read through them.
