Morris Kline's *Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach* starts with this statement:

    Anyone who adds to the plethora of introductory calculus texts owes an explanation, if not an apology, to the mathematical community. I believe that an introductory course in the calculus *should present the subject intuitively and should relate it as closely as possible to science*.  [my emphasis]

One excuse, in explaining how I came to annotate or assemble a book about calculus, is that it is primarily an exercise for myself.  Gathering together examples shamelessly appropriated from authors I particularly admire, I aim to solidify the ideas in my mind, as well as providing a ready reference containing my favorite derivations and examples.  But this is obviously not an authoritative book, I am just a student.

In addition to Kline, my other top calculus textbooks are Richard Hamming's *Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics*, and Gil Strang's *Calculus*.  Strang's book is excellent and is available for free on the web.

I only wish his lectures in that course had been recorded, as the lectures on linear algebra were.  These highlights are very nice too:

I also highly recommend these online books:

The first three books, at least, share a world view which minimizes the formalism of limits.  Here, we will manipulate differentials algebraically, and do so without guilt.  The basic theory is covered, but the goal is to get to applications.

One thing is missing:  there are no problems in this book, partly because I wanted to minimize the length.  However, to learn this material, you must do lots of problems.  As the old saying goes, "mathematics is not a spectator sport".

I hope you enjoy these ideas as much as I do.
