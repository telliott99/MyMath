Min-max Theorem
###############

Before getting to the Extreme Value Theorem, we start with the Min-max Theorem.  This one says that:

    if :math:`f` is continuous on :math:`[a,b]` then :math:`f` has at least one maximum and one minimum on :math:`[a,b]`.
    
Seems fairly obvious.

Here are some examples where the theorem applies:

And here are some examples where the theorem does not apply:
