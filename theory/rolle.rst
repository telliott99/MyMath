Rolle's Theorem
###############


Rolle's Theorem says that for a "nice" :math:`f`, if :math:`f(a) = f(b)`, then there will exist at least one point :math:`c` in the interval :math:`(a,b)` such that :math:`f'(c) = 0`.

from the *Lifesaver*

    To do this, we use the Max-Min Theorem to say that if :math:`f` has a global maximum and a global minimum in if :math:`[a, b]`.
    
    If either the maximum or the minimum occurs at some number if :math:`c` in if :math:`(a,b)`, then the Extreme Value Theorem says that if :math:`f′(c) = 0`. (We know that if :math:`f′(c)` exists since if :math:`f` is differentiable in if :math:`(a, b)`.)
    
    The only other possibility is that the global maximum and the global minimum both occur at the endpoints if :math:`a` and if :math:`b`. In that case, since if :math:`f(a) = f(b)`, the function must be constant, so every number if :math:`c` in if :math:`(a,b)` satisfies if :math:`f′(c) = 0`. That’s all there is to the proof!
